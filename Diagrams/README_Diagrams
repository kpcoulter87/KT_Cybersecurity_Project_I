This folder contains 2 network diagrams

The first is HW 12 Final.pdf
This outlines a network that goes through a jumpbox and ssh into the 3 web vms
These are sent through a load balancer to keep the network flexible

The second is the ELK stack deployed on the web vms 
This diagram is the same as HW 12 with an additional ELK VM accessed through the jumpbox via ssh in a different virtual network
